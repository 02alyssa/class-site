        <p>What I aim to do in my printing practice: include playful colors, experiment with layouts on a variety of mediums, and choosing new colors of ink. 
        </p>
        <p>This is why silent screenprinting is my love and passion: it serves as a therapeutic quietness. You're creating something entirtely new in real life, as well as finishing a project with something beautiful. </p>
