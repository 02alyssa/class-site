        <p><b>(WEEK 1)</b></p>
       </p>
       <p>What is a website? We explore into what defines handmade web and how we build a website from nothing. This article dives into related terms, metaphors, and discussions in building a world around your site. Schwulst also weighs on the importance of creating an individual space with practices and collections, especially in the growing corporate climate of web design software in our evolving technologies. Some great bird imagery is displayed as well in efforts to educate ourselves on varying topics.</p>

         <p>Ursula K. Le Guin: <i>A Rant On Technology</i>
        <p><b>(WEEK 1)</b></p>

We begin with the argument that all science fiction is technologicaal, in the hopes of providing a point of view towards desensitization of convient processes versus handmade processes. One quote to take away from this piece from Guin states: "Technology is the active human interface with the material world."</p><hr></hr>
